**How to build/start/run/compile the project:**

In the 'frontend' folder, open a terminal, and run the following commands:

npm install to install the required packages.

npm run dev to start the frontend server.

Simultaneously, in the 'backend' folder, open a terminal, and execute the following commands:

npm install to install the necessary packages.

npm start app to launch the backend server.

**Details of any important assumptions you have made during design or development:**

Data Availability and Format Assumptions:

We assume that the project will have access to the required data in a structured and accessible format.

Data sources are assumed to provide necessary endpoints or APIs for data retrieval.

Performance and Scalability Assumptions:

We assume that the MERN stack can handle the expected data load efficiently.

The initial project phase focuses on a data subset, with an assumption that the architecture is scalable for future data expansion.

Third-Party Integration Assumptions:

The project relies on third-party tools and libraries for data visualization, such as D3.js and Nivo.rocks.

Assumption that these libraries will integrate seamlessly with the MERN stack.

Security Assumptions:

Assumption that the project will implement necessary security measures to protect data and user interactions.

Technical Skill Assumptions:

Development assumes a team with adequate skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

**Provide details and links to learning resources â€“ which would help the team onboard a new developer. This should include an example application that you will have begun development on in class sessions between weeks 4 and 6:**

Good MERN Tutorial: https://blog.logrocket.com/mern-stack-tutorial/ I used vite to create the react app but the principles are good.

React Beginner Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk kind of similar to what Nathan taught in class.
